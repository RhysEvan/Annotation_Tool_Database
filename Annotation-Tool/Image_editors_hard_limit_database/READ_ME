These files were written with the intetion to use the code to create a database of images that can be handled by the AI.
The issue with using this system is that you put a hard limit on the amount of images. A better solution would be to keep the images at their 
original size and to make a dynamic script that opens the image and randomly takes out a crop from the image.
It can then manipulate the crop to completely randomize the image that the AI receives.
The files are kept in since they can be used for other forms and are in some way connected to the annotation tool.
